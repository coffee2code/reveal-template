# TODO

The following list comprises ideas, suggestions, and known issues, all of which are in consideration for possible implementation in future releases.

***This is not a roadmap or a task list.*** Just because something is listed does not necessarily mean it will ever actually get implemented. Some might be bad ideas. Some might be impractical. Some might either not benefit enough users to justify the effort or might negatively impact too many existing users. Or I may not have the time to devote to the task.

* Support BuddyPress
* Filter for reveal_to_current_user()?
* Add 'format' field to widget
* Add 'format' attribute to shortcode
* Add 'Shortcode' section to readme.txt to fully document shortcode
* Add 'Frequently Asked Questions' section to readme.txt. (incl mention of no mime-type template support)
* Add option to only output when WP_DEBUG is true. (Add docs to plugin page about this. Also, add admin notice when active and not active.)
* Add block implementation of shortcode
* Add option to allow reveal to be shown to all visitors, not just admins
* Add option dropdown to allow choice of where reveal is shown:
  * In footer (as currently done)
  * As HTML comment in footer (new feature)
  * In admin bar (new feature)
* Add custom capability
* Integrate admin bar node as subitem of Debug Bar when that plugin is active?
* Add setting to restrict reveal to only appear if WP_DEBUG is enabled?


Feel free to make your own suggestions or champion for something already on the list (via the [plugin's support forum on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/reveal-template/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/coffee2code/reveal-template/) as an issue or PR).
